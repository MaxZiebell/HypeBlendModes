*MODENAME* are color, color-burn, color-dodge, darken, difference, exclusion, hard-light, hue, lighten, luminosity, multiply, overlay, saturation, screen, soft-light.

<small>PS: there is an [older version](https://forums.tumult.com/t/hypeblendmodeenabler-1-1-with-thumbnail-preview-in-ide/12637) of this project using an symbol but this take is much more versatile, in my opinion.</small>
